This repository mainly contains my AI competition program, as well as some deep learning projects independent of the competition.

If you have learned something from it, don't forget to support this repository.

Currently, only the author maintains this repository, so there will inevitably be negligence. If you find any problems or have any suggestions, please contact us.
